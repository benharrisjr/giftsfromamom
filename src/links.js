I try to think ahead to the whole year when coming up with her list.  I got a pair of crocs this year and it was almost life changing.  I laugh at how silly that sounds but I really love them and I feel like I've been missing out.  These will be great for the pool, water table, or any other time she needs to slip on a shoe quickly.",

These pieces look like they're not cardboard and I think it'll be easier to use than the current home-made version.  I am looking forward to playing this with her as she grows so she can work on her memory and match making skills.  I think this game is really important for all toddlers to play.",
